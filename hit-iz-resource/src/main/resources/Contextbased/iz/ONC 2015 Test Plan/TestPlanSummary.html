<td><p>Description:</p>A two month old male infant, Russell Clinton Richardson, is brought to a clinic for a well child visit by his mother Maria Elizabeth Richardson (nee Billington) and his father John William Richardson. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider, Wilma Thomas (physician ID 654) reviews the patient's vaccination history and determines that the child previously received Hepatitis B vaccine 1 day after birth and 1 month after birth. The staff member determines that the patient needs DTaP, Hib, IPV, Rotavirus and Pneumococcal vaccinations. Because of the patient's status of Native American, he qualifies for all Vaccine For Children (VFC) supplied vaccines under the status of VFC eligible - American Indian/Alaska Native. The parents are given 5 Vaccine Information Sheets (VIS) to review. After reading them, they agree that the child should receive all the vaccinations recommended. They also agree that the data should be shared once it is incorporated into the local IIS. They indicate that reminders and recalls may be sent by any method. Appropriate doses of DTaP/Hib/IPV (Pentacel), Rotavirus (RotaTeq) and Pneumococcal (Prevnar 13) are selected from the clinic's stock of publically funded vaccines. A clinician, Lily Jackson (ID 7824) prepares and administers the doses to the patient and then enters the data into the EHR and transmits it to the IIS.<br/><p>Test Objectives:</p>Create an

<td><p>Description:</p>A child, James Smith, is brought to the local clinic to determine what immunizations have been given and what immunizations are needed. A clinic staff member collects basic patient demographic information including name, date of birth and sex. A clinic provider uses this information to locate the patient's medical record. The staff member then uses the medical record and system capabilities to query the IIS to request an evaluated history and forecast for the patient.<br/><p>Test Objectives:</p>Tests for a typically valued query message.</td>

<th>IZ-QR-4.2_Response_TM_K11_Z33</th>
<td><p>Description:</p>The IIS performs a search for James Smith and finds too many matches based on the sending system's query (e.g., EHR-S). The IIS returns a response message indicating no person found (too many matches) to the querying system. It is expected that the requesting system (e.g., EHR-S) process the response message and display some indication to the end user that the person was not found (too many matches).<br/><p>Test Objectives:</p>Test the capability of the EHR-S to process a response message that returns no persons found (too many matches) and to provide an indication to the end user.</td>
